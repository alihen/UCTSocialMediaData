{"name":"University of Cape Town Social Media Data Collection","tagline":"Data collected from UCT Social media accounts to aid reform in social media & communication policies at the University of Cape Town","body":"## **Why is this being done?**\r\nDuring the student fee protests that took place in South Africa from 17-23 October 2015, the University of Cape Town handled communication with students very poorly, not utilising their social media channels or replying to students' queries. The data collected in this project further confirms this and will be presented to the university's communication department with an extensive complaint and the motion to set up social media and communications policies.\r\n\r\n## **How can I contribute?**\r\nYou can contribute to this complaint by adding information to [the Google Form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1S4yQOkwKx557tPPeRONKznKjB66OSe2LNyyF4h72UqQ/viewform). Students have the option of submitting information anonymously. All information will be included in the complaint.\r\n\r\n## **When will the complaint be available for viewing?**\r\nThe complaint should be available for viewing by 11 November 2015. A link will be available on this page, otherwise follow me on Twitter.\r\n\r\n## **Twitter Statistics (19 October - 7 November 2015)**\r\n- **Tweets send from @UCT_News account: 228**\r\n- **Tweets sent in reply to students: 26**\r\n- **% of replies in User Timeline: 11.41%**\r\n- **Tweets sent with duplicate information: TBA**\r\n- **Tweets directed at User during the peroid: TBA**\r\n\r\n## **Technical details**\r\n### **@UCT_News Tweets**\r\nI used the Twitter API to get 3244 tweets from @UCT_News, with the relevant reply information included. I then saved this as a CSV and did the analysis on the data. In order to get the reply data, I needed to export the API data as UTF-8 & UTF-16 (for some reason CSV doesn't like `&amp` and breaks it into another tab in Excel, strange - UTF16 solved this by just giving me the mentions data). All CSV and scripts used are included in the GitHub repo.\r\n\r\n### **@UCT_News Direct Mentions**\r\nComing soon.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
